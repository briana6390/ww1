  <p>Letter: </p>
  <p>Apparently the exercise I had in military is a huge boost for me to escape from warzone. But because the warzone is way too large. Larger than I expect, I been running in the same direction for a month already and I still cannot find any people that aren't dressed like a soldier. I eventually ran out of food and I have been trying to so hard to save foods that are meant for 2 weeks. But now I ate them all already. I don't know when I am going die to any reason but if you see this letter, this means that I am already dead and you found this letter from my corpse. </p>
